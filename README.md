- Hi, I’m Aditya Nitin Pise.
- I have completed my Computer Engineering with honors in AI ML.
- I'm a software developer at Persistent Systems.
- My first project was a tablet-based application for one of the leading private banks in India. I worked with a backend team and was responsible for creating APIs in Java SpringBoot. It had a microservice   
  architecture hence involved connecting multiple services as well as to third-party APIs. Also implemented Apache Kafka as a retry mechanism.
- Currently, I'm working on an Internal Research Tool which is based on Generative AI. This tool involves the automatic generation and completion of various SDLC processes to improve the developer's productivity. 
  I'm responsible for creating a backend using Python, langchain. Using prompt engineering to ensure correct output is generated. 
- My interest is in backend development with a touch of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
